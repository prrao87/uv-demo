# Exploring `uv`: The 10x Python Package Manager

This repository contains code to demonstrate the basic features and ease of use of the
[`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

We will demonstrate how simple it is to set up and run `uv` by building a project that ingests data
about the cast and crew of the movie Interstellar into a graph database, [KÃ¹zu](https://kuzudb.com),
and then answer questions about the movie using a graph retrieval augmented generation
(Graph RAG) pipeline.

## Setup

The Python version we will use is 3.12. You can install `uv` using the following commands, depending
on your operating system:

```bash
# On macOS via Homebrew
brew install uv

# On Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Initialize the project

```bash
uv init
```

This creates a new `pyproject.toml` file in the root of the project.

If using a `requirements.txt` file, you can add all of its dependencies to the existing
`pyproject.toml` file:

```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

The dependencies in `pyproject.toml` file and its associated lock file `uv.lock` are installed
in a local virtual environment, in the directory `.venv`. To share the dependencies in a
platform-agnostic manner with your collaborators, you can simply commit the `uv.lock` file and
`pyproject.toml` to your repository.

To reproduce the same environment on another machine, your collaborators can run:

```bash
uv sync
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are relying on `uv` to manage your Python version, **you do not need to worry about virtual
> environments**. You can simply run `uv run <script>` and `uv` will use the Python version specified
> in your `pyproject.toml` file, and set up and manage the virtual environment for you.

## Running the demo

```bash
# Create the graph
uv run create_graph.py

# Run elementary Graph RAG on the newly constructed graph
uv run graph_rag.py
```
